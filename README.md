# Insurance_Claim
We have a huge data for insurance claim with more than 30 fields to analyse and find suitable results 

I have designed the following questions to analyse and find suitable results
## Questions

### 1. Which incident state had the highest number of poilcy claims ? -- To increase the premium for that state
### 2. Draw a conclusion between incident types and gender ?  -- To provide premium gender wise
### 3. Total claim amount and collision type ? -- To provide information about there relationship
### 4. Auto Model vs Total Claim Amount ?  -- Which car model have maximum claim amount


For the same, I have created a tableau dashboard.
